# ReactivePhoneword

This is a sample application based on the [Getting Started with Android](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/getting_started/)
guide by Xamarin.
It's been ported to use the [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) pattern and
[ReactiveUI](http://reactiveui.net/), as a learning experience to try to understand and apply those concepts and tools.
